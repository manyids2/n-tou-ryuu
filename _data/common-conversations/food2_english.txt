Conversations about food. 
Part 2

A: What are your thoughts on bread and butter?


B: Bread and butter? And where is the beer?


A: All right, are bread, butter and beer also fruits?


B: In Europe, breat, butter and wine are the seeds and our motherland is the fruit.


A: Are you sure it is a fruit and not a vegetable in disguise?


B: As much as I am certain you are not a traitor in disguise.


A: Well then, a toast to our tasty motherland!


B: Now toast and barbeque are an excellent idea.


A: What do you know about using fire to prepare food?


B: Broadly, the categories are boiling, cooking, frying, roasting and smoking I presume.


A: Boiling, cooking, frying, roasting and smoking? One for each weekday I guess.


B: Indeed, on Saturdays I eat raw fish and on Sundays I eat sunlight.


A: Oh, so you are from the clan of the legendary Sunday Sun eaters.


B: I must apologise on behalf of my legendary clan for the darkness of Mondays.


A: Your apologies sound sincere.


B: Indeed, boiled food is generally the worst.


A: I would say fasting is the worst.


B: Agreed, specifically, fasting is the worst.


A: Some say it is healthy.


B: Some healthy people look well fed.


A: Some well fed people look ill.


B: Some ill people need nutrition to get well.


A: So it is.
